            <p><strong>IaaS or Infrastructure-as-a-Service</strong> is a Cloud Computing model when provider offers a customer computational resources on demand. Customer is able to launch his own software including operation systems and applications. In that case, customer does not operate and doesn’t control the physical infrastructure but he is able to administrate all the software that’s in this infrastructure.</p>
			<p>This infrastructure has deep history. It was founded in 1925 in London. Interesting facts from Wikipedia:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The Incorporated Association of Architects and Surveyors became the Association of Building Engineers and then the Chartered Association of Building Engineers in 2014, its current name.</li>
				<li>The Infrastructure-as-a-Service was among the bodies named, together with the RIBA, in the First Schedule of the Act as being entitled to appoint one member in respect of every five hundred of their own members.</li>

			<p><strong>IaaS</strong> providers handle tasks including and users applications system maintenance, backup and resiliency planning. This platform offer confident resources that solve on-request. It makes this service work well for different availability that are temporary, trial or change by chance. On the other hand, IaaS environments include the automation of executive aims, dynamic scaling, desktop virtualization and policy-based services.</p>
			<p><strong>IaaS</strong> has its providers such as: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Windows Azure, Google Compute Engine, Rackspace Open Cloud, and others.</p>
			<p>lab3m clients use IaaS typically by the hour, week or month pay. We think, that users should monitor their IaaS environments closely to avoid being burdened for counterfeit software.</p>
